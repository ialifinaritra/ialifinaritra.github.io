Welcome on my website! 


My name is Ialifinaritra. I am currently a Deep Learning Research Intern at Idemia Identity & Security. My main subject focuses on how we can leverage unlabeled data to improve model performance. So, I performed benchmarks on semi-supervised learning methods applied on computer vision, especially face detection. 

After graduating from [Universit√© de Technologie de Compiegne](https://www.utc.fr/en/courses-and-training/the-utc-engineering-diploma.html) , I am pursuing Msc in applied mathematics and Data Science at [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home).

The goal of this website is to share my academic and personal project. 

I am enthusiast to learn new topics in artificial intelligence and I have strong interest in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing area. 

Feel free to reach me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ialifinaritra-rakotoniaina-bb3970106/) or by [e-mail](ialifinaritra@gmail.com) if you want to discuss about Machine Learning Projects or if you want us to work together.
